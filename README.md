- Hi, I’m @arther-nux or just Arthër
- I’m interested in all things technology and an avid learner. I have done the research and listened to hours on content about making stuff. I love DIY channels on YouTube and mostly catter my likes to well-polished videos with a nice level of production. As a self-learner I strive to make a world a little more green and a lot more happier to live in. I want to leave a legacy of improvement and progress.
- I’m currently learning full-stack web development, music theory and 3D modeling
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I understand and like. On plans of big things that will shape or will have a pretty nifty impact.
- How to reach me? . . . [Insert reach-stuff WIP](notaurl.com)
